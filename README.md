# 👋 Hi there, I'm Eugene Bertrand!

I’m a Computer Engineering student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with a deep passion for building intelligent, adaptive systems that bridge the gap between modern software and real-world impact. I specialize in applying computational thinking to diverse fields like artificial intelligence, edge computing, and full-stack development.

My academic journey is grounded in rigorous coursework and accelerated by hands-on research—ranging from developing power-aware schedulers for edge servers to creating AI models that analyze chemical efficacy for medical applications. Whether I'm designing CPU forecasting tools or building scalable web apps, I approach each challenge with curiosity, structure, and a strong commitment to problem-solving.
