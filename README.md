# 👋 Hi there, I'm Eugene Bertrand!

I’m a Data Science student at University of California, San Diego, with a deep passion for building intelligent, adaptive systems that bridge modern software with real-world impact. I specialize in applying computational thinking to diverse fields like artificial intelligence, edge computing, and full-stack development.

My academic journey blends rigorous coursework with hands-on research—ranging from developing power-aware schedulers for edge systems to creating AI models that analyze medical compounds and predict NFL player performance. Whether I'm building scalable web apps or anomaly detectors for e-commerce fraud, I approach every challenge with structure, curiosity, and a strong commitment to solving real problems.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🏈 [PlayPredict](#) — *Python, scikit-learn, Node.js, React, Express*  
An end-to-end platform that forecasts NFL player performance per game.  
- Built a TypeScript/Express REST API that ingests 400K+ rows of 2024 NFL play data and serves results in <100 ms  
- Trained RandomForest regressors (QB, RB, WR, TE) in Python, serialized models with Joblib, and integrated into the backend  
- Designed a responsive React frontend with dynamic input handling and real-time rendering  
- Added utilities for CSV repair and scripted automatic model retraining to maintain forecast accuracy  

### 🛒 [AutoFlag](#) — *Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit*  
A system to detect abusive e-commerce return behavior using anomaly detection.  
- Generated synthetic/real datasets with multiple fraud archetypes via a custom CLI tool  
- Engineered 15 behavioral features and implemented Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, and statistical scoring models  
- Built a Streamlit dashboard with <150 ms load time, adjustable filters, and visual analytics on customer trends and fraud heatmaps  

### 🧠 Serene AI — *Python, PyTorch, NVIDIA BioNemo*  
An AI model predicting compound efficacy for neurological treatments.  
- Visualizes molecules via SMILES strings using RDKit  
- Uses BioNemo for pretrained transformer-based chemical analysis  
- Predicts compound effectiveness with confidence scores  

### ⚙️ Edge CPU Forecaster — *Python*  
A simulation tool for adaptive workload scheduling on edge systems.  
- Implements slope-based analysis for CPU usage forecasting  
- Achieved up to **2.3×** throughput speedup and **18%** power savings on benchmarks  

### 🔎 GitViewer — *React, Node.js, GitHub API*  
A full-stack web app that fetches and displays GitHub user profiles by username.  
- Backend: Express routes integrated with GitHub REST API  
- Frontend: React UI with dynamic rendering and error handling  
- Skills: REST APIs, UX responsiveness, frontend/backend coordination
