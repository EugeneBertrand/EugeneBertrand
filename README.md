# 👋 Hi there, I'm Eugene Bertrand!

I’m a **Data Science student at UC San Diego (GPA 3.9, Dean’s Honor List)** with a passion for building intelligent, adaptive systems that blend **AI, full-stack development, and edge computing**. I enjoy taking research ideas and turning them into **production-ready tools** that have real-world impact.

My experience spans across **software engineering internships, AI/ML research, and independent projects**. Whether I’m scaling recommendation systems, fine-tuning NLP models, or building anomaly detectors, I bring a structured, curious, and hands-on approach to solving problems.
